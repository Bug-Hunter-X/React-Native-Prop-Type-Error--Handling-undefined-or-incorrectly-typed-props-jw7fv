This error occurs when you use a component that expects a specific prop type, but the prop is not provided or is of the wrong type.  For example, if a component expects a string prop and you provide a number, you'll get a type error.  React Native will often throw errors like `TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.props.someProp')` or similar. This points towards a missing or incorrectly typed prop.
